# WorkOS AuthKit Direct Integration Changes

This document summarizes the changes made to integrate WorkOS AuthKit directly without requiring a backend redirect.

## Changes Made

1. **Added SSO Route Handler (app/auth/sso/route.ts)**
   - Created a server-side route handler that uses WorkOS AuthKit directly
   - Handles the redirection to WorkOS on the server side, avoiding client-side node modules

2. **Simplified SSO Page (app/auth/sso/page.tsx)**
   - Reduced to a simple loading UI
   - Actual SSO logic handled by the route handler

3. **Updated SignOut Button (app/dashboard/sign-out-button.tsx)**
   - Now uses AuthKit's `signOut()` function directly
   - Removed backend API call for sign-out

4. **Updated Protected Route (components/protected-route.tsx)**
   - Now uses AuthKit's `useAuth()` hook for authentication status
   - Checks for `auth.user` to determine if the user is authenticated
   - Simplified authentication logic

5. **Updated Next.js Config (next.config.mjs)**
   - Fixed ES modules compatibility issue
   - Simplified webpack configuration

6. **Added Documentation**
   - Created setup instructions for WorkOS AuthKit
   - Listed required environment variables
   - Added testing instructions

## Architecture Overview

1. **AuthKit Middleware (middleware.ts)**
   - Already configured for WorkOS AuthKit
   - Defines unauthenticated paths

2. **AuthKit Provider (app/layout.tsx)**
   - Already wraps the application with `AuthKitProvider`

3. **Route Handlers**
   - **SSO Route (app/auth/sso/route.ts)**
     - Handles SSO initiation on the server side
     - Uses WorkOS AuthKit's `getSignInUrl()` function
   
   - **Login Route (app/login/route.ts)**
     - Already uses AuthKit's `getSignInUrl()` function
     - Provides alternate entry point for authentication

   - **Authentication Callback (app/auth/callback/route.ts)**
     - Handles authentication callback from WorkOS
     - Syncs user data with your backend

## Required Environment Variables

For the direct integration to work, you need to set up the following environment variables:

```
WORKOS_API_KEY=your_workos_api_key
WORKOS_CLIENT_ID=your_workos_client_id
WORKOS_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:3000/auth/callback
WORKOS_COOKIE_NAME=authkit
WORKOS_COOKIE_DOMAIN=localhost
```

## Benefits of Direct Integration

1. **Simplified Flow**: Uses WorkOS AuthKit's built-in functionality directly
2. **Reduced Backend Dependency**: No need for backend redirects for authentication
3. **Automatic Token Management**: AuthKit handles token storage and validation
4. **Built-in Authentication State**: AuthKit provides authentication state through hooks
5. **Server-Side Processing**: Handles node.js dependencies on the server side, avoiding client-side compatibility issues

## Next Steps

1. Set up the required environment variables in your `.env` file
2. Test the SSO flow by navigating to `/auth/sso`
3. Consider removing any now-unused backend routes related to SSO:
   - `/api/sso/authorize`
   - `/api/sso/callback`
   - `/api/auth/sso`

## Implementation Notes

Our solution uses a route handler to process WorkOS AuthKit authentication server-side:

1. When a user navigates to `/auth/sso`, the route handler (route.ts) intercepts the request
2. The route handler uses WorkOS AuthKit's server-side functions to get the sign-in URL
3. The user is redirected directly to WorkOS for authentication
4. After authentication, WorkOS redirects to the configured callback URL
5. The AuthKit callback handler processes the authentication and logs the user in

This approach avoids client-side Node.js module dependencies while maintaining a direct integration with WorkOS AuthKit.
